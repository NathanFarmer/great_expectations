We’re committed to supporting and growing the community around Great Expectations. It’s not enough to build a great tool. We want to build a great community as well.

Open source doesn’t always have the best reputation for being friendly and welcoming, and that makes us sad. Everyone belongs in open source, and Great Expectations is dedicated to making you feel welcome.

### Get in touch with the Great Expectations team
Join our public slack channel here: [join slack](https://greatexpectations.io/slack). We’re not always available, but we’re there and responsive an awful lot of the time.

### Ask a question
Slack is good for that, too: [join slack](https://greatexpectations.io/slack).

### File a bug report or feature request
If you have bugfix or feature request, please [upvote an existing issue](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/issues) or [open a new issue](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/issues/new) on GitHub and we’ll see what we can do.


### Contribute code or documentation
